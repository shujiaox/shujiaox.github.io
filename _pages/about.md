- I am a first-year Ph.D. student in the [School of Art, Design and Media](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/adm) at [Nanyang Technological University](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/), advised by Prof. [Kristy H.A. Kang](https://dr.ntu.edu.sg/cris/rp/rp01142) and Prof. [Ina Conradi Chavez](https://inaconradi.com/). My research interests lie in the intersection of art and technology, particularly in **interactive media art**, **media architecture** and **creative robotics**, as well as their applications in digital humanities, cultural heritage preservation and urban regeneration. 

- I am a fan of east asian poetry, art, history and urban photography. My dream is to interpret poems and distant lands with codes.
