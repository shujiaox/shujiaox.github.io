excerpt: 'The relocation and resettlement project in Southern Shaanxi has a large scale and involves many aspects. This project brings new problems to the ecological environment of the region, such as lacking ecological planning and copying the pattern of urban residential district in the planning and construction of immigrant resettlement areas. Based on perspective of ecology, the planning strategy and design method are explored in the resettlement area. And site selection, ecological environment construction and the layout pattern of the resettlement area are studied from the macro regional ecological environment to the micro community residential environment. It is proposed to promote entire ecological construction of the resettlement areas, improve the pattern of spatial layout and strengthen the protection and use of the natural environment around resettlement areas, so as to provide a reasonable planning method for the formation of new communities and construct ecological pattern of the resettlement areas suitable for the regional environment.'

The resettlement project in Southern Shaanxi is featured with a large amount of planning and construction in the scope of town. Due to the disconnection with the village and town planning and the lack of overall consideration on the ecological environment, problems have occurred such as the disorder of town spatial structure and ecological destruction. Based on the planning system of village and town, adopting theÿtheoriesÿandÿmethodsÿof landscapeÿecology, the planning system of resettlement areas is constructed with the integration of the landscape ecological evaluation methods. It focuses on the resettlement area construction at a level of overall planning. And the ideasÿandÿmethods are presented to strengthen the connection between the planning of resettlement areas and town planning, and to promote the coordination of the resettlement construction and ecological protection.
