**Abstract:** The resettlement project in Southern Shaanxi is featured with a large amount of planning and construction in the scope of town. Due to the disconnection with the village and town planning and the lack of overall consideration on the ecological environment, problems have occurred such as the disorder of town spatial structure and ecological destruction. Based on the planning system of village and town, adopting theÿtheoriesÿandÿmethodsÿof landscapeÿecology, the planning system of resettlement areas is constructed with the integration of the landscape ecological evaluation methods. It focuses on the resettlement area construction at a level of overall planning. And the ideasÿandÿmethods are presented to strengthen the connection between the planning of resettlement areas and town planning, and to promote the coordination of the resettlement construction and ecological protection.
