title: "Analysis on the Spatial Characteristics of Traditional Settlements in Harmony with Nature in Loess Plateau of Northern Shaanxi"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/paper02
excerpt: 'Northern Shaanxi is the typical area of Loess Plateau in China with alleys and gullies crisscrossed. In such a distinctive geographical environment, the traditional settlements rely on the natural landscape and make full use of topographical features. Then the spatial form of the mountainous human settlements is formed in harmony with nature. Combined with literatures and field investigation, from the aspects of spatial distribution, site selection, spatial form and layout, the spatial characteristics of the traditional settlements in Northern Shaanxi are analyzed. What’s more, the internal regularities and useful experience of how to adapt to nature and make use of it are summarized, providing a research foundation for the sustainable development of human settlements in this region.'
