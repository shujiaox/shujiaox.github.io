title: "3D Printed Maltose Pattern from Real-time Audio-Visualization"
excerpt: "We designed and developed an interactive installation where the audio-visualization patterns can be printed by the robot arm from the edible maltose, thereby participants could create the physical artworks based on their sound through human-robot interaction. The highlight of working on such a novel project was to protect and utilize the intangible cultural heritage, Sugar Painting, in an unconventional form with robot technologies. <br/><img src='/files/ProjectImage/DSC00391.JPG'>"
