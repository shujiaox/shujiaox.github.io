title: "Interaction Design of Acousto-optic Robotic Arm"

excerpt: "The project aimed at using the small KUKA Agilus KR6-10 R1100-2 to complete an interactive acousto-optic performance. The background music came from seraph, the first album of Metasonar's black noise series. We transformed the frequency of sound waves into the robot motion. And the light effects were amplified by prisms refraction to create an immersive spatial audio-visual experience.<br/><img src='/files/ProjectImage/DSC00394.jpg'>"
